## 📋 **SITUATION** - The Challenge
Space missions require 24/7 monitoring of thousands of satellites, real-time collision detection, mission planning, and immediate response to critical events. Traditional mission control centers demand constant human oversight, leading to:

- **Human fatigue errors** during long monitoring shifts
- **Delayed response times** to critical space events
- **Resource-intensive operations** requiring large ground control teams
- **Limited scalability** for managing growing satellite constellations
- **High operational costs** for continuous human supervision

Modern space operations need **autonomous, intelligent systems** that can operate independently while maintaining NASA-grade reliability and safety standards.
